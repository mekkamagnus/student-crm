# Issue #1: Set up Deno project and basic HTTP server

## Link to Issue
https://github.com/mekkamagnus/student-crm/issues/1

## Plan
1. Implement a simple HTTP server in `src/main.ts` using Deno's standard library.
2. Create a placeholder `public/index.html` file.
3. Modify `src/main.ts` to read and serve this HTML file.
4. Ensure the server starts correctly and serves the HTML.
5. Update the UI test (`test/csv_upload_ui.test.ts`) to assert for the correct content from the served HTML.
