### Todo Summary
- **Total tasks completed:** 1
- **Total tasks remaining:** 35
- **Completed tasks:**
  - Initialize SQLite database connection and define schema (`database.ts`) #2
- **Incomplete tasks:** All other tasks in `TODO.md` are incomplete.

### Key Accomplishments
- Successfully initialized SQLite database connection using `deno-sqlite`.
- Defined a basic schema for a `users` table.
- Implemented `initializeDatabase` and `createSchema` functions in `src/database.ts`.
- Wrote and passed unit tests for database initialization and schema creation.
- Created a new branch `feature/issue-2-sqlite-database`.
- Created a scratchpad for issue #2.
- Created and merged a pull request for issue #2.

### Features Implemented
- Basic SQLite database connection and schema creation.

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
- Initial `git diff` command was incorrect, resolved by using `git diff --stat <commit-hash>..HEAD`.
- The `Schema Creation` test initially failed because `db.query("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")` returned more than one table due to SQLite's internal tables. This was resolved by modifying the query to specifically look for the `users` table: `SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='users'`.

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- No new dependencies were explicitly added or removed during this session, as `sqlite` was already present in `deno.json`.

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `TODO.md` to mark task #2 as complete.

### Deployment Steps Taken
- None.

### Lessons Learned
- Always verify `git diff` commands carefully.
- Be aware of SQLite's internal tables when querying for schema information.

### What Wasn't Completed
- No other tasks from the `TODO.md` were addressed in this session.

### Tips for Future Developers
- The `initializeDatabase` and `createSchema` functions are now available in `src/database.ts` for further database interactions.
