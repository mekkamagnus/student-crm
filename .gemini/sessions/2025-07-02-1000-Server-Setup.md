**Todo Summary:**
*   **Completed tasks:**
    *   `Set up Deno project and basic HTTP server (main.ts, deno.json) #1` (Partially completed: `deno.json` created, `src/main.ts` updated, but server not yet successfully run/verified).
*   **Remaining tasks:** All other tasks in `TODO.md` are still pending.

**Key Accomplishments:**
*   Created the `deno.json` file with basic configuration, including `deno_puppeteer` imports and necessary Deno permissions.
*   Created the `src` directory and initial empty files (`main.ts`, `database.ts`, `handlers.ts`, `repository.ts`).
*   Created the `public` directory and a placeholder `public/index.html` file.
*   Updated `src/main.ts` to serve the `public/index.html` file.
*   Created `test/csv_upload_ui.test.ts` with a basic failing UI test using `deno_puppeteer`.
*   Updated `TODO.md` to include GitHub issue numbers for all tasks.
*   Created a GitHub repository (`student-crm`) and generated GitHub issues for all tasks listed in `TODO.md`.
*   Updated `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new task management strategy (GitHub Issues), the purpose of the `ai_docs` directory, and the guideline for writing tests per function.
*   Aggregated GEMINI CLI documentation into `ai_docs/gemini_cli_docs.md`.

**Problems Encountered and Solutions:**
*   **Repeatedly getting stuck in a loop:** The primary challenge was the repeated cancellation of `deno task start` commands, which prevented verification of server setup and progression. This highlighted the need for explicit user confirmation for shell commands that launch long-running processes.
*   **`gh issue create` and `git commit -m` issues:** Encountered syntax errors when using special characters (like parentheses) in `gh issue create --body` and `git commit -m`. Solved by using single quotes for the entire string and, in some cases, writing the body to a temporary file and using `--body-file` or escaping special characters with backslashes.

**What wasn't completed:**
*   Successfully running and verifying the Deno server.
*   Successfully running the UI test to confirm its expected failure.

**Tips for future developers:**
*   Be mindful of shell escaping when passing complex strings to `gh` commands or `git commit -m`. Using `--body-file` or a temporary file for longer messages can prevent issues.
*   Ensure all necessary Deno permissions (`--allow-net`, `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-env`, `--allow-run`) are granted for tasks and tests that require them.
