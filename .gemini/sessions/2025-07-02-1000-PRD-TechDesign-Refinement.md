## Goals
The primary goal of this session was to refine the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Technical Design documents, define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope, and establish the core tech stack and deployment considerations for the Student CRM application. This involved:
- Clarifying the distinction between 'details' and 'reason' in OperationLog based on CSV data.
- Confirming the derivation of 'targetAudience' in MembershipPlan.
- Defining the idempotent CSV import mechanism and its requirements.
- Establishing the MVP user stories focused on CSV import and dashboard display.
- Documenting the chosen tech stack (TypeScript, HTMX, Tailwind CSS, SQLite, Handlebars, Alpine.js).
- Noting Deno as the runtime and clarifying routing will be implemented later.
- Adding deployment considerations for Mainland China (firewall, CDN, .env).
- Documenting the context of the iWo WeChat miniapp and future custom miniapp plans.
- Creating a general spec template.
